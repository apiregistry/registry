    "name": "AWS CodePipeline(2015-07-09)",
    "description": "   <b>Overview<\/b>   This is the AWS CodePipeline API Reference. This guide provides descriptions of the actions and data types for AWS CodePipeline. Some functionality for your pipeline is only configurable through the API. For additional information, see the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html\">AWS CodePipeline User Guide<\/a>.  You can use the AWS CodePipeline API to work with pipelines, stages, actions, gates, and transitions, as described below.   <i>Pipelines<\/i> are models of automated release processes. Each pipeline is uniquely named, and consists of actions, gates, and stages.   You can work with pipelines by calling: <ul> <li>   <a>CreatePipeline<\/a>, which creates a uniquely-named pipeline. <\/li> <li>   <a>DeletePipeline<\/a>, which deletes the specified pipeline. <\/li> <li>   <a>GetPipeline<\/a>, which returns information about a pipeline structure. <\/li> <li>   <a>GetPipelineExecution<\/a>, which returns information about a specific execution of a pipeline. <\/li> <li>   <a>GetPipelineState<\/a>, which returns information about the current state of the stages and actions of a pipeline. <\/li> <li>   <a>ListPipelines<\/a>, which gets a summary of all of the pipelines associated with your account. <\/li> <li>   <a>StartPipelineExecution<\/a>, which runs the the most recent revision of an artifact through the pipeline. <\/li> <li>   <a>UpdatePipeline<\/a>, which updates a pipeline with edits or changes to the structure of the pipeline. <\/li> <\/ul>  Pipelines include <i>stages<\/i>, which are which are logical groupings of gates and actions. Each stage contains one or more actions that must complete before the next stage begins. A stage will result in success or failure. If a stage fails, then the pipeline stops at that stage and will remain stopped until either a new version of an artifact appears in the source location, or a user takes action to re-run the most recent artifact through the pipeline. You can call <a>GetPipelineState<\/a>, which displays the status of a pipeline, including the status of stages in the pipeline, or <a>GetPipeline<\/a>, which returns the entire structure of the pipeline, including the stages of that pipeline. For more information about the structure of stages and actions, also refer to the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipeline-structure.html\">AWS CodePipeline Pipeline Structure Reference<\/a>.  Pipeline stages include <i>actions<\/i>, which are categorized into categories such as source or build actions performed within a stage of a pipeline. For example, you can use a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline from a source such as Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with actions directly in most cases, but you do define and interact with actions when working with pipeline operations such as <a>CreatePipeline<\/a> and <a>GetPipelineState<\/a>.   Pipelines also include <i>transitions<\/i>, which allow the transition of artifacts from one stage to the next in a pipeline after the actions in one stage complete.  You can work with transitions by calling: <ul> <li>   <a>DisableStageTransition<\/a>, which prevents artifacts from transitioning to the next stage in a pipeline. <\/li> <li>   <a>EnableStageTransition<\/a>, which enables transition of artifacts between stages in a pipeline.  <\/li> <\/ul>   <b>Using the API to integrate with AWS CodePipeline<\/b>   For third-party integrators or developers who want to create their own integrations with AWS CodePipeline, the expected sequence varies from the standard API user. In order to integrate with AWS CodePipeline, developers will need to work with the following items:   <b>Jobs<\/b>, which are instances of an action.

To provide end-user credentials, first make an unsigned call to <a>GetId<\/a>. If the end user is authenticated with one of the supported identity providers, set the <code>Logins<\/code> map with the identity provider token. <code>GetId<\/code> returns a unique identifier for the user.  Next, make an unsigned call to <a>GetCredentialsForIdentity<\/a>. This call expects the same <code>Logins<\/code> map as the <code>GetId<\/code> call, as well as the <code>IdentityID<\/code> originally returned by <code>GetId<\/code>. Assuming your identity pool has been configured via the <a>SetIdentityPoolRoles<\/a> operation, <code>GetCredentialsForIdentity<\/code> will return AWS credentials for your use. If your pool has not been configured with <code>SetIdentityPoolRoles<\/code>, or if you want to follow legacy flow, make an unsigned call to <a>GetOpenIdToken<\/a>, which returns the OpenID token necessary to call STS and retrieve AWS credentials. This call expects the same <code>Logins<\/code> map as the <code>GetId<\/code> call, as well as the <code>IdentityID<\/code> originally returned by <code>GetId<\/code>. The token returned by <code>GetOpenIdToken<\/code> can be passed to the STS operation <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity.html\">AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity<\/a> to retrieve AWS credentials.  If you want to use Amazon Cognito in an Android, iOS, or Unity application, you will probably want to make API calls via the AWS Mobile SDK.

Planning data center migrations can involve thousands of workloads that are often deeply interdependent. Application discovery and dependency mapping are important early first steps in the migration process, but difficult to perform at scale due to the lack of automated tools.  The AWS Application Discovery Service automatically collects configuration and usage data from servers to develop a list of applications, how they perform, and how they are interdependent. This information is securely retained in an AWS Application Discovery Service database which you can export as a CSV file into your preferred visualization tool or cloud migration solution to help reduce the complexity and time in planning your cloud migration.

The following are short descriptions of each API action, organized by function.   <b>Managing AWS Agents Using the Application Discovery Service<\/b>   An AWS agent is software that you install on on-premises servers and virtual machines that are targeted for discovery and migration. Agents run on Linux and Windows Server and collect server configuration and activity information about your applications and infrastructure. Specifically, agents collect the following information and send it to the Application Discovery Service using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption: <ul> <li>  User information (user name, home directory) <\/li> <li>  Group information (name) <\/li> <li>  List of installed packages <\/li> <li>  List of kernel modules <\/li> <li>  All create and stop process events <\/li> <li>  DNS queries <\/li> <li>  NIC information <\/li> <li>  TCP/UDP process listening ports <\/li> <li>  TCPV4/V6 connections <\/li> <li>  Operating system information <\/li> <li>  System performance <\/li> <li>  Process performance <\/li> <\/ul>  The Application Discovery Service API includes the following actions to manage AWS agents: <ul> <li>   <i>StartDataCollectionByAgentIds<\/i>: Instructs the specified agents to start collecting data. The Application Discovery Service takes several minutes to receive and process data after you initiate data collection. <\/li> <li>   <i>StopDataCollectionByAgentIds<\/i>: Instructs the specified agents to stop collecting data. <\/li> <li>   <i>DescribeAgents<\/i>: Lists AWS agents by ID or lists all agents associated with your user account if you did not specify an agent ID. The output includes agent IDs, IP addresses, media access control (MAC) addresses, agent health, host name where the agent resides, and the version number of each agent. <\/li> <\/ul>   <b>Querying Configuration Items<\/b>   A <i>configuration item<\/i> is an IT asset that was discovered in your data center by an AWS agent. When you use the Application Discovery Service, you can specify filters and query specific configuration items. The service supports Server, Process, and Connection configuration items. This means you can specify a value for the following keys and query your IT assets: <p class=\"title\"> <b>Server<\/b>  <ul> <li>  server.HostName <\/li> <li>  server.osName <\/li> <li>  server.osVersion <\/li> <li>  server.configurationId <\/li> <li>  server.agentId <\/li> <\/ul> <p class=\"title\"> <b>Process<\/b>  <ul> <li>  process.name <\/li> <li>  process.CommandLine <\/li> <li>  process.configurationId <\/li> <li>  server.hostName <\/li> <li>  server.osName <\/li> <li>  server.osVersion <\/li> <li>  server.configurationId <\/li> <li>  server.agentId <\/li> <\/ul> <p class=\"title\"> <b>Connection<\/b>  <ul> <li>  connection.sourceIp <\/li> <li>  connection.sourcePort <\/li> <li>  connection.destinationIp <\/li> <li>  connection.destinationPort <\/li> <li>  sourceProcess.configurationId <\/li> <li>  sourceProcess.commandLine <\/li> <li>  sourceProcess.name <\/li> <li>  destinationProcessId.configurationId <\/li> <li>  destinationProcess.commandLine <\/li> <li>  destinationProcess.name <\/li> <li>  sourceServer.configurationId <\/li> <li>  sourceServer.hostName <\/li> <li>  sourceServer.osName <\/li> <li>  sourceServer.osVersion <\/li> <li>  destinationServer.configurationId <\/li> <li>  destinationServer.hostName <\/li> <li>  destinationServer.osName <\/li> <li>  destinationServer.osVersion <\/li> <\/ul>  The Application Discovery Service includes the following actions for querying configuration items.  <ul> <li>   <i>DescribeConfigurations<\/i>: Retrieves a list of attributes for a specific configuration ID. For example, the output for a <i>server<\/i> configuration item includes a list of attributes about the server, including host name, operating system, number of network cards, etc. <\/li> <li>   <i>ListConfigurations<\/i>: Retrieves a list of configuration items according to the criteria you specify in a filter. The filter criteria identify relationship requirements. For example, you can specify filter criteria of process.name with values of <i>nginx<\/i> and <i>apache<\/i>. <\/li> <\/ul>   <b>Tagging Discovered Configuration Items<\/b>   You can tag discovered configuration items. Tags are metadata that help you categorize IT assets in your data center. Tags use a <i>key<\/i>-<i>value<\/i> format. For example, <code>{\"key\": \"serverType\", \"value\": \"webServer\"}<\/code>.  <ul> <li>   <i>CreateTags<\/i>: Creates one or more tags for a configuration items. <\/li> <li>   <i>DescribeTags<\/i>: Retrieves a list of configuration items that are tagged with a specific tag. <i>Or<\/i>, retrieves a list of all tags assigned to a specific configuration item. <\/li> <li>   <i>DeleteTags<\/i>: Deletes the association between a configuration item and one or more tags. <\/li> <\/ul>   <b>Exporting Data<\/b>   You can export data as a CSV file to an Amazon S3 bucket or into your preferred visualization tool or cloud migration solution to help reduce the complexity and time in planning your cloud migration. <ul> <li>   <i>ExportConfigurations<\/i>: Exports all discovered configuration data to an Amazon S3 bucket. Data includes tags and tag associations, processes, connections, servers, and system performance. This API returns an export ID which you can query using the GetExportStatus API. <\/li> <li>   <i>DescribeExportConfigurations<\/i>: Gets the status of the data export.

For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as cryptographically signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">Tools for Amazon Web Services<\/a> page.  <\/note>  We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to IAM.

We strongly recommend that you do not use your AWS account access key ID and secret access key for everyday work with IAM. You can use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user or you can use the AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials and use those to sign requests.  To sign requests, we recommend that you use <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\">Signature Version 4<\/a>. If you have an existing application that uses Signature Version 2, you do not have to update it to use Signature Version 4. However, some operations now require Signature Version 4.

You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are the variables you want to measure for your resources and applications.  CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources you are monitoring based on rules that you define. For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and then use this data to determine whether you should launch additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this data to stop under-used instances to save money.  In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS, you can monitor your own custom metrics.

It provides cost-efficient, resizeable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their applications and businesses unique.  Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, or Amazon Aurora database server. These capabilities mean that the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your existing databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up your database and maintains the database software that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your database instance's compute resources and storage capacity to meet your application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources you use.  This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Note that Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied.

SSM includes an on-demand solution called <i>Amazon EC2 Run Command<\/i> and a lightweight instance configuration solution called <i>SSM Config<\/i>.   This references is intended to be used with the EC2 Run Command User Guide for <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/execute-remote-commands.html\">Linux<\/a> or <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/execute-remote-commands.html\">Windows<\/a>. <note>  You must register your on-premises servers and VMs through an activation process before you can configure them using Run Command.

You can use pre-defined SSM documents to perform the actions listed later in this section, or you can create your own documents. With these documents, you can remotely configure your instances by sending commands using the <b>Commands<\/b> page in the <a href=\"http://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/\">Amazon EC2 console<\/a>, <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Amazon_Simple_Systems_Management_cmdlets.html\">AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell<\/a>, the <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ssm/index.html\">AWS CLI<\/a>, or AWS SDKs.  Run Command reports the status of the command execution for each instance targeted by a command. You can also audit the command execution to understand who executed commands, when, and what changes were made. By switching between different SSM documents, you can quickly configure your instances with different types of commands. To get started with Run Command, verify that your environment meets the prerequisites for remotely running commands on EC2 instances (<a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/remote-commands-prereq.html\">Linux<\/a> or <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/remote-commands-prereq.html\">Windows<\/a>).  <p/>   <b>SSM Config<\/b>   SSM Config is a lightweight instance configuration solution. SSM Config is currently only available for Windows instances. With SSM Config, you can specify a setup configuration for your instances. SSM Config is similar to EC2 User Data, which is another way of running one-time scripts or applying settings during instance launch. SSM Config is an extension of this capability. Using SSM documents, you can specify which actions the system should perform on your instances, including which applications to install, which AWS Directory Service directory to join, which Microsoft PowerShell modules to install, etc. If an instance is missing one or more of these configurations, the system makes those changes. By default, the system checks every five minutes to see if there is a new configuration to apply as defined in a new SSM document. If so, the system updates the instances accordingly. In this way, you can remotely maintain a consistent configuration baseline on your instances. SSM Config is available using the AWS CLI or the AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-configuration-manage.html\">Managing Windows Instance Configuration<\/a>.  SSM Config and Run Command include the following pre-defined documents.   <b>Linux<\/b>  <ul> <li>   <b>AWS-RunShellScript<\/b> to run shell scripts <\/li> <li>   <b>AWS-UpdateSSMAgent<\/b> to update the Amazon SSM agent <\/li> <\/ul> <p/>   <b>Windows<\/b>  <ul> <li>   <b>AWS-JoinDirectoryServiceDomain<\/b> to join an AWS Directory <\/li> <li>   <b>AWS-RunPowerShellScript<\/b> to run PowerShell commands or scripts <\/li> <li>   <b>AWS-UpdateEC2Config<\/b> to update the EC2Config service <\/li> <li>   <b>AWS-ConfigureWindowsUpdate<\/b> to configure Windows Update settings <\/li> <li>   <b>AWS-InstallApplication<\/b> to install, repair, or uninstall software using an MSI package <\/li> <li>   <b>AWS-InstallPowerShellModule<\/b> to install PowerShell modules  <\/li> <li>   <b>AWS-ConfigureCloudWatch<\/b> to configure Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications and systems <\/li> <li>   <b>AWS-ListWindowsInventory<\/b> to collect information about an EC2 instance running in Windows. <\/li> <li>   <b>AWS-FindWindowsUpdates<\/b> to scan an instance and determines which updates are missing. <\/li> <li>   <b>AWS-InstallMissingWindowsUpdates<\/b> to install missing updates on your EC2 instance. <\/li> <li>   <b>AWS-InstallSpecificWindowsUpdates<\/b> to install one or more specific updates. <\/li> <\/ul> <important>  The commands or scripts specified in SSM documents run with administrative privilege on your instances because the Amazon SSM agent runs as root on Linux and the EC2Config service runs in the Local System account on Windows. If a user has permission to execute any of the pre-defined SSM documents (any document that begins with AWS-*) then that user also has administrator access to the instance. Delegate access to Run Command and SSM Config judiciously. This becomes extremely important if you create your own SSM documents. Amazon Web Services does not provide guidance about how to create secure SSM documents. You create SSM documents and delegate access to Run Command at your own risk. As a security best practice, we recommend that you assign access to \"AWS-*\" documents, especially the AWS-RunShellScript document on Linux and the AWS-RunPowerShellScript document on Windows, to trusted administrators only. You can create SSM documents for specific tasks and delegate access to non-administrators. <\/important>  For information about creating and sharing SSM documents, see the following topics in the SSM User Guide:  <ul> <li>   <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-ssm-doc.html\">Creating SSM Documents<\/a> and <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ssm-sharing.html\">Sharing SSM Documents<\/a> (Linux) <\/li> <li>   <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/create-ssm-doc.html\">Creating SSM Documents<\/a> and <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ssm-sharing.html\">Sharing SSM Documents<\/a> (Windows) <\/li> <\/ul>",

    "description": "  The AWS Support API reference is intended for programmers who need detailed information about the AWS Support operations and data types. This service enables you to manage your AWS Support cases programmatically. It uses HTTP methods that return results in JSON format.  The AWS Support service also exposes a set of <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/\">Trusted Advisor<\/a> features. You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check results, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of checks.   The following list describes the AWS Support case management operations: <ul> <li>   <b>Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels. <\/b>The <a>DescribeServices<\/a> and <a>DescribeSeverityLevels<\/a> operations return AWS service names, service codes, service categories, and problem severity levels. You use these values when you call the <a>CreateCase<\/a> operation.  <\/li> <li>   <b>Case creation, case details, and case resolution.<\/b> The <a>CreateCase<\/a>, <a>DescribeCases<\/a>, <a>DescribeAttachment<\/a>, and <a>ResolveCase<\/a> operations create AWS Support cases, retrieve information about cases, and resolve cases. <\/li> <li>   <b>Case communication.<\/b> The <a>DescribeCommunications<\/a>, <a>AddCommunicationToCase<\/a>, and <a>AddAttachmentsToSet<\/a> operations retrieve and add communications and attachments to AWS Support cases.  <\/li> <\/ul>  The following list describes the operations available from the AWS Support service for Trusted Advisor: <ul> <li>   <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks<\/a> returns the list of checks that run against your AWS resources. <\/li> <li>  Using the <code>checkId<\/code> for a specific check returned by <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks<\/a>, you can call <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult<\/a> to obtain the results for the check you specified. <\/li> <li>   <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries<\/a> returns summarized results for one or more Trusted Advisor checks. <\/li> <li>   <a>RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck<\/a> requests that Trusted Advisor rerun a specified check.  <\/li> <li>   <a>DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses<\/a> reports the refresh status of one or more checks.  <\/li> <\/ul>  For authentication of requests, AWS Support uses <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\">Signature Version 4 Signing Process<\/a>.
