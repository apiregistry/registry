Typically, you use <code>AssumeRole</code> for cross-account access or federation. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRole</code> with the other APIs that produce temporary credentials, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html\">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison\">Comparing the AWS STS APIs</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.  <b>Important:</b> You cannot call <code>AssumeRole</code> by using AWS root account credentials; access is denied. You must use credentials for an IAM user or an IAM role to call <code>AssumeRole</code>.  For cross-account access, imagine that you own multiple accounts and need to access resources in each account. You could create long-term credentials in each account to access those resources. However, managing all those credentials and remembering which one can access which account can be time consuming. Instead, you can create one set of long-term credentials in one account and then use temporary security credentials to access all the other accounts by assuming roles in those accounts. For more information about roles, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/roles-toplevel.html\">IAM Roles (Delegation and Federation)</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.  For federation, you can, for example, grant single sign-on access to the AWS Management Console. If you already have an identity and authentication system in your corporate network, you don't have to recreate user identities in AWS in order to grant those user identities access to AWS. Instead, after a user has been authenticated, you call <code>AssumeRole</code> (and specify the role with the appropriate permissions) to get temporary security credentials for that user. With those temporary security credentials, you construct a sign-in URL that users can use to access the console. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html#sts-introduction\">Common Scenarios for Temporary Credentials</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. The temporary security credentials are valid for the duration that you specified when calling <code>AssumeRole</code>, which can be from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to a maximum of 3600 seconds (1 hour). The default is 1 hour.  The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRole</code> can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: you cannot call the STS service's <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> APIs. Optionally, you can pass an IAM access policy to this operation. If you choose not to pass a policy, the temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation have the permissions that are defined in the access policy of the role that is being assumed. If you pass a policy to this operation, the temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation have the permissions that are allowed by both the access policy of the role that is being assumed, <i> <b>and</b> </i> the policy that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for the resulting temporary security credentials. You cannot use the passed policy to grant permissions that are in excess of those allowed by the access policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_control-access_assumerole.html\">Permissions for AssumeRole, AssumeRoleWithSAML, and AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. To assume a role, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate access to this account's role. The user who wants to access the role must also have permissions delegated from the role's administrator. If the user is in a different account than the role, then the user's administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call AssumeRole on the ARN of the role in the other account. If the user is in the same account as the role, then you can either attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous different account user), or you can add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy  <b>Using MFA with AssumeRole</b>  You can optionally include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when you call <code>AssumeRole</code>. This is useful for cross-account scenarios in which you want to make sure that the user who is assuming the role has been authenticated using an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication; if the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example.  <code>\"Condition\": {\"Bool\": {\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\": true}}</code>  For more information, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html\">Configuring MFA-Protected API Access</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i> guide. To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters. The <code>SerialNumber</code> value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The <code>TokenCode</code> is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA devices produces.

When the federated user makes an AWS request, AWS evaluates the policy attached to the federated user in combination with the policy or policies attached to the IAM user whose credentials were used to call <code>GetFederationToken</code>. AWS allows the federated user's request only when both the federated user <i> <b>and</b> </i> the IAM user are explicitly allowed to perform the requested action. The passed policy cannot grant more permissions than those that are defined in the IAM user policy. A typical use case is that the permissions of the IAM user whose credentials are used to call <code>GetFederationToken</code> are designed to allow access to all the actions and resources that any federated user will need. Then, for individual users, you pass a policy to the operation that scopes down the permissions to a level that's appropriate to that individual user, using a policy that allows only a subset of permissions that are granted to the IAM user.  If you do not pass a policy, the resulting temporary security credentials have no effective permissions. The only exception is when the temporary security credentials are used to access a resource that has a resource-based policy that specifically allows the federated user to access the resource.
